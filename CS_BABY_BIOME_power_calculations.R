# function to estimate power for linear regresison with binary predictor
#beta: your coefficient from regression
#Y.sd: standard deviation of your outcome
# proportion.cases: ratio between number of cases and total number of samples
# alpha: significance level
# power: power you want. 
#k: number of predictors,i.e. number of covariates plus one. Note that for multilevel factors it is Nlevels - 1,
# so for the model: outcome ~ phenotype_binary + DNA_concentration + BATCH , for 4 batches, this "k" equals to 5
